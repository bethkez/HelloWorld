<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>HTML is a basic code for making Web pages. There are several parts to HTML to make different parts of the website show up and work. These complex parts make the complete website work smoothly. </p>
<br>
<p> I wanted to take this class because whatever career path I choose, I know it will be helpful. If I go into teaching, I can make websites for my students to use or teach them how to code websites on their own. If I get my business degree, I can use these tools to create websites for places I may work at.</p>
